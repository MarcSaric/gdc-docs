# GDC VCF Format

## Introduction

The GDC VCF file format follows standards of the [Variant Call Format (VCF) Version 4.1 Specification](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.1.pdf). Raw Simple Somatic Mutation VCF files are unannotated, whereas Annotated Somatic Mutation VCF files include extensive, consistent, and pipeline-agnostic annotation of somatic variants.

## VCF file structure

### Meta-information

The meta-information section of a VCF file comprises lines that begin with `##`. Some key components of this section are:

*  __gdcWorkflow:__ information on GDC pipelines that were used to generate the VCF file. GDC annotated VCF files contain two *gdcWorkflow* lines, one representing the variant calling process and the other representing the variant annotation process.
*  __INDIVIDUAL:__ information about the study participant, including:
 	* *NAME:* Submitter ID (barcode) associated with the participant
	* *ID:* GDC case UUID
*  __SAMPLE:__ sample information, including:
	*  *ID:* NORMAL or TUMOR
	*  *NAME:* Submitter ID (barcode) of the aliquot
	*  *ALIQUOT_ID:* GDC aliquot UUID
	*  *BAM_ID:* BAM file UUID
*   __INFO:__ format of *additional information* fields
	*  NOTE: GDC Annotated VCFs may contain multiple INFO lines. The last INFO line contains information about annotation fields generated by the [Somatic Annotation Workflow](/Data_Dictionary/viewer/#?view=table-definition-view&id=somatic_annotation_workflow) (see [GDC INFO Fields](#gdc-info-fields) below).
*   __FILTER:__ description of filters that have been applied to the data
*   __FORMAT:__ description of genotype fields
*   __reference:__ the reference genome used to generate the VCF file
*   __contig:__ IDs for the contiguous DNA sequences that appear in the reference genome used to produce VCF files
	*  NOTE: Annotated VCFs include contig information for autosomes, sex chromosomes, and mitochondrial DNA. Unplaced, unlocalized, human decoy, and viral genome sequences are not included.
*   __VEP:__ the VEP command used by the [Somatic Annotation Workflow](/Data_Dictionary/viewer/#?view=table-definition-view&id=somatic_annotation_workflow) to generate the annotated VCF file.

### Part 2: Column Header Line

This is a single tab-delimited line that names the data columns in the following order:

0. __CHROM:__ chromosome
0. __POS:__ position
0. __ID:__ identifier
0. __REF:__ reference base(s)
0. __ALT:__ alternate base(s)
0. __QUAL:__ quality
0. __FILTER:__ filter status
0. __INFO:__ additional information
0. __FORMAT:__ format of sample genotype data
0. __NORMAL:__ normal sample genotype data
0. __TUMOR:__ tumor sample genotype data

See [Variant Call Format (VCF) Version 4.1 Specification](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.1.pdf) for details.

### Part 3: Data

This part of a VCF file contains tab-delimited information, one line per record, with each record representing a position in the genome.

## GDC INFO fields

The following variant annotation fields are currently included in Annotated Somatic Mutation VCF files.  Please refer to the [DNA-Seq Analysis Pipeline](../Bioinformatics_Pipelines/DNA_Seq_Variant_Calling_Pipeline.md) documentation for details on how this information is generated. [VEP Documentation](http://useast.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/vep_formats.html#output) provides additional information about some of these fields.
