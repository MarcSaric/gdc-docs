# Cocleaning Workflow #

## Description ##

Cocleaning is the process in which DNA-Seq alignments are optimized by comparing paired tumor/normal samples.

## Overview ##

The DNA-Seq alignment cocleaning workflow comprises two steps: Base quality score recalibration (BQSR) and indel realignment. 

### Tools ###

Both cocleaning steps are implemented using the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK).
