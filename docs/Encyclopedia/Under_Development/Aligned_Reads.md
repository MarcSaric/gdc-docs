# Aligned Reads #
## Description ##
A read is a sequence obtained from a single sequencing experiment. Typically a read is produced when a base calling program interprets information from a chromatogram trace file produced from a sequencing machine. An aligned read, is a sequence that has been aligned to a common reference genome.
## Overview ##
The GDC supports the submission of aligned reads, in addition to unaligned reads. A data file containing aligned reads is used as input to GDC workflows.
Eventually, aligned reads, which were aligned to the [GRCh38 human genome](LINK) build with standardized protocols based on data type, are also generated by the GDC bioinformatics pipelines. Generated aligned read files also contain unaligned reads to facilitate the retrieval of raw data by end users.
### Data Formats ###
Aligned reads are maintained in [Binary Alignment Map](LINK) (BAM) format.
