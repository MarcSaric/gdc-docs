## Overview ##
Sequence trace files (or chomatograms) contain the raw data output from sequencers employing automated Sanger-based sequencing.  This sequencing methodology and file format have largely been replaced by next-generation sequencing and BAM or FASTQ formatted data.  This file type can be found in the GDC Legacy Archive.
