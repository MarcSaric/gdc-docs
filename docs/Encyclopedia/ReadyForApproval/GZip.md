# GZip #
## Description ##
Gzip is an application and file format used in file compression.
## Overview ##
Gzip was created to serve as a free replacement for other Unix compression utilities.  The Gzip compression method has the advantage of compressing across a number of files and finding the redundancy between them to compress a tar bundle of files further then just compressing each file in the file bundle. Gzip uses Lempel-Ziv (LZ77) coding for compression and was designed to keep the original file name and timestamp of the files in the compressed file.
