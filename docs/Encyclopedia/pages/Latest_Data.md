# Latest Data #

## Description ##

The latest data refers to the current collection of files and metadata available at the GDC.       

## Overview ##

A large-scale data commons that provides processed data files will inevitably start to have newer versions of data files due to pipeline improvements, data redactions, and other modifications that can happen during data curation. The default setting for the GDC is to provide the latest version of the data<sup>1</sup>. In some cases older versions of files will be made available upon request, but will not necessarily be discoverable. All versions of files from cases that have been redacted will be made completely unavailable<sup>2</sup>.
