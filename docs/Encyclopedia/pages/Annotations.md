Annotations
===========================
The GDC Data Portal supports the use of annotations for any submitted entity or file. An annotation entity may include key comments about why particular patients, samples, or files are not present or why they may exhibit critical differences from others. Annotations include information that cannot be submitted to the GDC through other existing nodes or properties.

Annotations are automatically downloaded with impacted files when using the Data Transfer Tool.  Annotations may also be searched via the [API](/API/Users_Guide/Search_and_Retrieval/#annotations-endpoint) or on the annotations page of the [GDC Data Portal](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/annotations).

If a submitter would like to create an annotation, please contact the GDC Support Team (support@nci-gdc.datacommons.io).
