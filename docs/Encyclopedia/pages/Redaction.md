# Redaction #
## Description ##

A redaction is the removal of data from the GDC at a submitter's request.

## Overview ##

Because the GDC aims to make data available consistently, redactions are generally rare and performed only in specific instances<sup>1</sup>. For example, cases must be redacted when the subject withdraws consent, the TSS/BCR subject link is incorrect ("unknown patient identity"), or in the cases of genotype mismatch (i.e. when a sample is shown to be from the wrong cancer, organ, or tissue)<sup>1</sup>. Redacted cases and their associated files are not displayed in the GDC Data Portal. More generally, a redaction hides the redacted entity and all child entities. Any questions about the redaction status of a case can be directed to GDC User Support<sup>2</sup>.
