# Cohort Set Analysis

In addition to the [Exploration page](XXXXXXX), the GDC Data Portal also has features used to compare cohorts.  These cohorts can either be generated with existing filters (e.g. males with lung cancer) or through custom selection (e.g. a user-generated list of patient IDs).


## Generating a cohort for Analysis

Cohort sets are completely customizable and can be generated for cases, genes, or mutations using the following methods:

__Upload ID Set:__ This feature is available in the "Manage Sets" link at the top right of the Portal. Choose "Upload Set" and then select whether the set comprises cases, genes, or mutations. A set of IDs (UUIDs or submitter IDs) can then be uploaded in a text file or copied and pasted into the field.

__Apply Filters in Exploration:__



## Analysis Tab: Set Operations

## Analysis Tab: Cohort Comparison

The "Cohort Comparison" analysis displays a series of graphs and tables that demonstrate the similarities and differences between two case sets.  


## Analysis Tab: Results

The results of the previous analyses are displayed here. Each tab at the left side of the page is labeled according to the analysis type and the date that the analysis was performed. The "Delete All" button will removed all of the previous analyses.
