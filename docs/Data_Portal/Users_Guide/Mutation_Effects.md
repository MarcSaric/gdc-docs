# Impact Categories

## VEP

* __HIGH (H)__: The variant is assumed to have high (disruptive) impact in the protein, probably causing protein truncation, loss of function, or triggering nonsense mediated decay
* __MODERATE (M)__: A non-disruptive variant that might change protein effectiveness
* __LOW (L)__: Assumed to be mostly harmless or unlikely to change protein behavior
* __MODIFIER (MO)__: Usually non-coding variants or variants affecting non-coding genes, where predictions are difficult or there is no evidence of impact

## PolyPhen

* __probably damaging (PR)__: It is with high confidence supposed to affect protein function or structure
* __possibly damaging (PO)__: It is supposed to affect protein function or structure
* __benign (BE)__: Most likely lacking any phenotypic effect
* __unknown (UN)__: When in some rare cases, the lack of data does not allow PolyPhen to make a prediction

## SIFT

* __tolerated__: Not likely to have a phenotypic effect
* __tolerated_low_confidence__: More likely to have a phenotypic effect than 'tolerated'
* __deleterious__:  Likely to have a phenotypic effect
* __deleterious_low_confidence__: Less likely to have a phenotypic effect than 'deleterious'
